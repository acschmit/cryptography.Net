# cryptography.Net
An easy to use AES and RSA cryptography library written in C#, built on the Bouncy Castle API. With this library you can quickly and easily incorporate AES-256 and RSA encryption into your project. The C# and Java version of these projects are the same at the API level.

If you develop in both Java and C# then this project and the <a href="https://github.com/acschmit/cryptography" target="_blank">Java project</a> are worth taking a look at.  They share the same API.  The Unit Tests and Examples are the same between them as well to illustrate their similarity.
